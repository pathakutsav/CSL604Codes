Experiment No. 2-: Symbol Table Generation

AIM-: Write a program to scan the input program and generate a symbol table.

DESCRIPTION-: Symbol table is a data structure containing a record for each identifier with fields
for the attributes of the identifier. The attributes may give the information about the Storage allocated
for the identifier, Data type and Scope of the identifier. By using these records each of the identifiers
can be retrieved easily and quickly. During the Lexical Analysis the identifiers will be found and
stored into the Symbol table but the attributes will not be stored in lexical phase. The Compiler and
the Assembler will be having their own Symbol tables.
The expression will be given as the input and the output obtained will be containing the table of
information about the identifiers.

ALGORITHM-:
1. Start.
2. Get an expression as input.
3. Separate each and every token.
4. If the token is id then create an entry in symbol table and enter the identifier name and its
corresponding data type.
5. Check the data type of each identifier and assign the corresponding memory location.
6. Check whether the identifier is having a value, if so enter that in the symbol table for that
identifier.
7. If the token is already entered in the table, avoid repeated entry.
8. Stop.
